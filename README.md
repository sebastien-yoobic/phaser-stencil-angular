# phaser-stencil-angular

Stencil web components containing a game made with Phaser.

The importation of Phaser is left to the framework, once Phaser has been imported,
it can be passed as a props to the Stencil component. All the code used to run the game is compiled with Stencil.

This allow cross-framework re-utilization of your game.

Games are organised with a factory pattern allowing you to easily chose the game you want to play from your framework.

### Steps to install

Clone the repo

```
  npm run install:sub
  npm run serve
```

`npm run serve` will build the stencil components in the assets of the angular project, copy the asset of the game
from stencil to angular and launch the angular project.

##### PS: you may need to install angular-cli globaly first or change the package.json at the ng command call

### Informations

Phaser 2.6.2 is used for the moment, next step is to go to Phaser 3.2.0

Phaser is not imported in the stencil-project.

If you want typescript to use Phaser typing you can import files from phaser/typescript.

### Process to add a new game

Create a new file in lib/game based on example.game

Export it in the index.ts file of the folder.

Add it to the game-factory.

##### Make sure that all GAME_NAME are differents !

TODO add test about that
